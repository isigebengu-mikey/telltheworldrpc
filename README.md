# telltheworldrpc
A simple Discord RPC!

To use this just download the installer.

You can make your RPC by going to the [Discord Developer Dashboard](https://discord.com/developers) and creating a new application:

Make a name for the Application, then head to **Rich Presence -> Art Assets**

and upload the image you want to use! (it has to be at least 512x512)

It takes a while for them to upload, so be patient! Once it's done, go back to **General Information** and click `Copy ID`. Paste this into the `Client ID` box in TellTheWorld, and then press connect. Now just enter the name of the image for `Image Key`, the top text, and the bottom text!
